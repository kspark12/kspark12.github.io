        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p id="history1">My Great grand pops Clayton Bud Sparks business as standard oil was called city service in spindale. When sparkies 
          opened it was in Forest City, originally a Chrysler dealership which became Cadillac, oldsmobile then subaru…</p>

         <p id="history2">When Bud returned from serving in WW2 he worked in the local textile mill in Spindale, NC. He saved his money and bought a 
          Standard Oil franchise in Spindale leaving the textile mill behind. He along with his brother then bought a piece of land nearby 
          & began selling used cars, traveling to Detroit and buying as many cars as they could to supply the local market. Selling cars 
          was such a success he sold the Standard Oil business to focus on selling cars full time. This used car business evolved into 
          the purchase of a Cadillac & Oldsmobile Dealership in Spindale primarily to gain access to financing. Sparkies Motors operated 
          throughout Bud’s lifetime passing on to his sons & eventually closing its doors after more than 50 years of operation with the 
          retirement of his eldest son and the passing of his youngest.</p>

          <p id="new"><strong>My Father and I are proud to continue the legacy of my Great Grandfather, and are excited to see how things turn 
            out and where this new business will take us!</strong></p>
