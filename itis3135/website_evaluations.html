                <h3><a href="https://berkshirehathaway.com/">The Crappy Page: Berkshirehathaway</a></h3>
                <p>Looks to be just a little company page with some links added to it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>This websites colors are very bland but they dont clash and the contrast is fine</li>
                    <li><strong>Repition: </strong>The links are all spread out accross the page and basically is the main attraction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Though the website is poor, everything has its place and is well aligned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>In my opinion the links are too spaced out, the header and footer text is too smushed together, 
                        and the overall page has an add proximity</li>

                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.nike.com/">The Better Webpage: Nike</a></h3>
                <p>This the online shop for the sports/clothing Brand Nike</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Crontrast: </strong> Coloring is straight and to the point, it has a well layed out color scheme that is easy no the eyes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repition: </strong> It is hard to claim that a clothing website has Repition since it is repeating the same graphic for different items over and over again
                        , thats just how it is</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment: </strong> All of the images and links are well aligned and the website has a user friendly lay out where things are easy to find</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>The text has good spacing, the images are well set within the boxes for each item, the page flows well. Again it is a user friendly 
                        well layed out site</li>
                </ul>
