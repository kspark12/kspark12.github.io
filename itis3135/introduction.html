            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born and raised in Charlotte, NC. I am a transfer student at UNCC. 
                Before I transferred here, I was playing soccer as a goalkeeper at a small college in the Mountains near Asheville, 
                NC called Montreat College. UNC Charlotte has been a blessing and I am fortunate to have such an opportunity to succeed right in front 
                of me. </li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> My first job was in a barbeque restaurant called Rockstore BBQ where I learned how to
                 essentially run the store. I could do anything from working the register, to putting pork butts in the smoker, to doing dishes,
                  and even sides prep. This past summer I worked at a Leslie’s pool store where I learned water chemistry and tested people’s pool 
                  water all summer.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with a 
                concentration in Cyber Security. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I have taken comp sci classes in high school and I am currently pursuing a firewall
                 security certification alongside my coursework this semester. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> I currently have a Microsoft Surface running on the Windows OS.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 3146 - Intro to Operating Systems and Networking:</strong> Course is pivotal, networks and operating 
                        systems are extremely important to cybersecurity.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong> I would like to pursue bodybuilding when I get a bit older, 
                I work out consistently and have had fellow Gym enthusiasts tell me I have the frame that could set me up for success. 
                Plus it is something I am interested in.</li>
